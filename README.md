## Game instructions

Click on any field to start a game. You must click on every generated field until all fields are gray to complete the level. <br>
After completing every level you gain 1 life. <br>
When losing level you lose as many lives as you have unclicked fields on board. <br>
After closing your browser your max level and lives will be saved so you can come back later and continue playing. <br>
Try to win all 99 levels!

## Moving rules

There is always a way to finish level. <br>
Next clickable field is generated 3 fields left, right, up or down from clicked field or 2 fields diagonally in evry direction from clicked field. <br>

```sh
gray field = clicked
white field = next clickable
black field = clickable during the game
```

In start it will be simple but later...you will see... <br>
Good luck!
